Odin Project JavaScript Course Project #4

In this project I learned about:

- How to use the .forEach method from the Array global object
- The importance of using basic data structures (Objects, Arrays), and the ability to perform basic operations on them
- How to use the localStorage API, JSON to store application data
- How to use factories in combination with classes to further organize projects
